# Minesweeper 

Command line version of the classic Minesweeper. For now, game is incomplete. About ~85% finished. 

~~To-do: Figure out how to reveal the number of adjacent bombs to neighbors of a selected tile. Been receiving a stack flood error in recursive method.~~ UPDATE: Implemented working iterative solution.
